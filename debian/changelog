  * debian/control:
     - added dependencies on pkg-config and libglib2.0-dev to gaim-dev, but

        dpkg doesn't replace directories with symlinks or vice versa

     - the conflicts/replaces of gaim-data on gaim that Ari added went
        missing between 1.1.1-3 and 1.1.1-4... I added the replaces but
        conflicting with old gaim packages prevents upgrades (see policy
        7.3) due to never unpacking conflicting packages side-by-side

     script.

  * debian/TODO.Debian:
     - rename to gaim-dev.TODO so dh_installdocs automatically includes it in
        the right place

  * debian/control:
     - replace suggests of evolution with evolution-data-server
     - make gaim-dev depend on gaim-data because of /usr/share/doc symlink
     - tweak descriptions

  * debian/rules:
     - explicitly disabled silc support until #273871 progresses
     - install changelogs and documentation in the gaim-data package only, and
        make gaim and gaim-dev symlink to it (allowed by policy as they both
        depend on gaim-data)
     - instruct dh_installman to install dh_gaim's manpage
     - run dh_installdocs manually for gaim-dev to install only the files we
        need on top of those in gaim-data
     - don't bother removing /usr/lib/gaim/*.la files - they are not installed
        any more

  * debian/gaim.install:
     - install only /usr/lib/gaim/*.so files
     - don't try and install the perl5 directory any longer

  * debian/gaim.preinst:
     - moved aside to gaim.preinst.old because we no longer need to remove
        /usr/share/doc/gaim if it is a symlink - it is once more a symlink

  * debian/gaim-dev.install:
     - don't install /usr/lib/gaim/*.la files

  * debian/gaim-dev.manpages:
     - removed in favour of variable in debian/rules

  * New upstream version. Massive thanks to Ari for all his help with the
     previous releases.

  * debian/patches/libtoolize.patch, debian/relibtoolize:
     - removed, should no longer be necessary now Debian's architectures are
        supported by upstream libtool

  * debian/rules:
     - disable perl support for now, its bitrotted enough to be nearly
        useless, and is slated for removal in 2.0 unless anyone fixes it

  * debian/control:
     - remove build dependency on automake1.8 because we no longer touch any
        of the generated files
     - remove perl build dependencies and substvars entries

       gevolution plugin
       (closes: #274030)
    - added evolution to Suggests field for people who want to use gevolution
    - added new gaim-dev and gaim-data packages, which split out the
       development headers & libraries and architecture-independent data.
       (closes: #233350, #162653, #234853, #267682, #274023)

  * debian/README.Debian.dev:
    - added README for Debian developers to explain how gaim plugins
      should be packaged.

  * debian/rules:
    - added dependency excludes for /usr/lib/gaim/gevolution.so, since
       we added Suggests for that manually.
    - clean up binary-post-install override to not remove the development
       files, since we put them in gaim-dev now.
    - added build/gaim-dev override to generate man page for
      dh_gaim, and added cleanbuilddir/gaim-dev override to clean it up.

  * debian/dh_gaim
    - added, thanks to Tollef Fog Heen for writing this.

     - not only was the patch turned out by my script complete garbage even on

        were building gaim in /home/robot101/debian/0.80/gaim-0.80 - this patch

     - this version builds the zephyr plugin against an external libzephyr,

     CVS was just made usable now in preparation for a release, so I'm just
     packaging it instead:

     to not actually fixing the Yahoo! problem, and installed Perl all wrong.
     Since 0.68 we've added Contact support, Tcl plugins, SSL for Jabber
     and the new MSN plugin, and fixed the Yahoo! connection problems. Also,
     I'm experimenting with a new changelog format.

         presents an error on unknown types             (closes: #212941)

        support works on arm, m68k and friends (thanks Keybuk)
  * debian/patches/cvs-yahoo-tweak.patch:
     - tweak to Yahoo! authentication code [from CVS]
  * debian/patches/gtkspell-locale.patch:
     - sets the GtkSpell dictionary according to the current locale. Not
        merged upstream because blah blah Windows aspell blah blah, but I
        don't really care. Sigh.                        (closes: #202009)

  * debian/control:
     - standards version 3.6.1
     - dropped build conflicts in light of --disable-nss working properly
        now (I submitted a patch just before 0.69)
     - added versioned build-depend on libperl-dev >= 5.8.1, because DESTDIR
        just decided to start working in MakeMaker, and I don't see how to
        consistently support builds both with and without that functionality
        without grossly hacking the build system
     - change Tcl build-depend to tcl8.3-dev, which is all it supports at
        the moment, and add tk8.3-dev for Tk support
     - added ${perl:Depends} to depends
  * debian/gaim.docs:
     - removed plugins/SIGNALS because it's gone upstream - all the API docs
        are moving into Doxygen, and I'll consider shipping them whenever
        upstream starts shipping header files
  * debian/rules:
     - add --disable-nss to ensure consistent SSL library choice

gaim (1:0.68+0.69cvs20030917-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * CVS snapshot. Contains SSL support for Jabber and the new MSN plugin,
     contact support, a Tcl plugin loader, and the two patches that were
     in 0.68-1.
  * Added build depends for GNUTLS and Tcl, and conflicts for NAS and NSS
     (because we don't build with this functionality).

  * New upstream version.                               (closes: #209021)
     - new event system and perl API
     - ignores MSN's upgrade spam (new MSN plugin will be in 0.69)
     - fixes Jabber registration                        (closes: #208070)
     - now includes code to retrieve, parse and display Yahoo and MSN
        profiles                                        (closes: #201498)
  * Start using the simple patch system from cdbs:
     - cvs-libgaim-remote-glib.diff: link libgaim-remote with glib
        [from CVS]                                      (closes: #210652)
     - cvs-yahoo-version.diff: update Yahoo protocol version to avoid
        warnings and/or allow signing in [from CVS]

gaim (1:0.67-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply my patch from CVS to stop the ticker crashing when it's reloaded
     (enterprising hack to make GType reuse the existing type instead of
     trying to register it again).                      (closes: #203727)
  * Apply fix from CVS to stop crashes if you don't have yourself on your
     buddy list (the developers all do this because it's the best way
     to track your own status at the moment).           (closes: #206574)

 -- Robert McQueen <robot101@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Aug 2003 04:54:11 +0100

gaim (1:0.67-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apparently libgaim-remote is too small to warrant a package of its own
     until anything else wants to use it.
  * Tweak description again to make less of an issue of license and widget
     set.                                               (closes: #205518)

gaim (1:0.67-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version with much core/UI splitting work and a cool new
     key/value XML-based prefs engine, rewritten IRC plugin, status icons
     in conversation tabs, a tab colour for unseen status messages, and
     various dialog rewrites.         (closes: #202666, #202742, #203471)

  * Merged all the patches from 0.64-3 and should fix a few other bugs:
      - store proxy settings correctly         (closes: #195035, #195304)
      - wait for the remote buddy list to download (on AIM/ICQ) before
         maniupulating buddies                 (closes: #195655, #196445)
      - display remote aliases correctly                (closes: #196664)
      - new prefs system works now                      (closes: #200810)
      - apparently this one is fixed in 0.66 too        (closes: #205093)

   * Between 0.64 and 0.67, various fairly crucial MSN bugfixes were made,
      preventing all manner of infinite loops, unclosable chat windows,
      cloned buddies, and the like.   (closes: #199421, #199515, #200655)
                             (closes: #203306, #203309, #203866, #204960)

  * Skipped 0.65 because it was a little broken, hence the hasty release of
     0.66.
  * Skipped 0.66 because I decided to switch to cdbs while I was reworking
     the packaging for the new libgaim-remote library, and it turned out
     the build system was subtly broken and needed fixing. These fixes
     are in this version. So it builds. Hurrah.
  * By skipping two versions, I shielded you all from the harsh disappearance
     of the Message Notification plugin in 0.65 and 0.66. Which was my plan
     all along, of course.

  * Medium urgency because this is a pretty solid release with lots of bug
     fixes, and 0.64-3 sucked.
  * Split out library and -dev packages for the new libgaim-remote0 library.
  * Switched to CDBS. Shrunk debian/rules somewhat. :D
  * Made the description less AIM-centric.
  * Updated standards version to 3.6.0.

gaim (1:0.64-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Medium urgency because MSN and Yahoo are fairly broke in the previous
     release, which should *not* be immortalised in testing.
  * Added patch from CVS to fix various MSN crashes and corruption of
     your friendly name.                                (closes: #195603)
  * Added patch from CVS to fix crash for buddy lists sorted by status.
                                               (closes: #196338, #196515)
  * Backported fix from CVS to fix Yahoo's new penchant for lower-case
     user names.
  * Backported fix so AOL mail is not checked if you disable the option.
                                                        (closes: #196733)
  * Corrected spelling error in Oscar (also in CVS).    (closes: #196840)

 -- Robert McQueen <robot101@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Jun 2003 02:34:32 +0100

gaim (1:0.64-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to standards version 3.5.10.
  * Replaced the Debian menu icon with a nice-looking one now that the menu
     policy doesn't mandate a crappy pallete.
  * So I spent a day cleaning the BTS for the Gaim package. Closed about 20
     bugs, reassigned 3 and fixed 7. This is the second batch of fixes.
  * Adjust wording so iconaway plugin no longer claims to minimise the away
     window, which is a dialog and shouldn't (or sometimes can't) be
     minimised. It wasn't doing it anyway.              (closes: #188821)
  * Linkify text appended by the history plugin if the option is enabled
     to do this for conversations.                      (closes: #189511)
  * Validate UTF8 for incoming server-stored aliases because clients like
     Trillian send us random encodings but call them UTF-8. Avoids nasty
     crashing.                                          (closes: #189662)
  * Added a "Close" button to the file transfer dialog. (closes: #192366)

gaim (1:0.64-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
   - Fixes some MSN problems, spiffs the debug window some more, and more
     core/ui splitting work from Chip the living legend.
   - New user request API fixes age-old dangling callback problems with
     prompt dialogs such as the IRC nick change dialog. (closes: #189946)
  * Made the signon meter window not dialog hinted, so you can ignore it and
     carry on using Gaim while your eleventy billion accounts sign in. Found
     and fixed a leak in the process.                   (closes: #187996)
  * Fixed a minor typo which caused "</FONT>" to be appended even when the
     font dialog was cancelled.                         (closes: #188048)
  * Fixed "Copy link location" menu entry the right way. The correct clipboard
     to copy to is... both of them.                     (closes: #191301)

gaim (1:0.63-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. The 'I am happy ChipX86' version. He hacked loads on
     this release, giving us a new MSN plugin, a new plugin API, and brought
     us far closer to a core/UI split than we've ever done before. Three
     cheers for Chip! Also thanks to faceprint, you can put chats in your
     buddy list once more. And there was much rejoycing.

                                                        (closes: #188819)

   new icons and spacing to improve the look of the buddy list. New
   more flexible buddy pounce code.

gaim (1:0.60.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Actually 0.60, but 0.60.0 is higher than the
     versions on my CVS debs. Skipped 0.59.9, oh well.  (closes: #184493)
     - it has been in development for almost a year, and a third of all the
       code has been rewritten in porting to Gtk2!
     - features new buddy list with optional large buddy list icons
                                                        (closes: #130436)
     - group folding is persistent across signons and signoffs
                                                        (closes: #133238)
     - i18n fixed and rewritten in all protocols
                                               (closes: #155058, #185531)
     - adds X11R6 session management support            (closes: #151272)
     - new sound system with libao has arts plugin      (closes: #170960)
     - adds "Display remote nick if no alias is set" option which can display
        and update MSN friendly names automatically     (closes: #176466)
     - other cool stuff like XML-based buddy list, global groups, asynchronous
        DNS lookups, draggable conversational tabs, tray icon plugin to
        replace the GNOME applet, ICQ server-stored buddy lists, cute new
        PNG icons, external sounds...
  * Added long title to Debian menu entry.              (closes: #175379)
  * Disabled NAS support. Feel free to add it to libao.
  * Dropped licq2gaim.pl, it doesn't work with XML buddy list format.
  * Tweaked debian/rules with new build options and such.
  * Updated build-deps with Gtk2 etc, updated standards version, suggest
     gnome-panel, kicker or docker for the tray icon plugin, and detail the
     new arrangement in the description.
  * Updated README.Debian with triumphant post-release banter.
  * Wrote a manpage for gaim-remote. Fancy that.

gaim (1:0.59.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The 'roll on 0.60' release.
  * New upstream version. I'd apologise for the delay, but I put the
     interesting fixes in 0.59.7-1 so there was no hurry anyway.
  * No longer build the GNOME applet variant. It only works with GNOME
     1.4 which isn't shipped in Debian sid any more. Furthermore, the
     applet won't exist in the Gtk2 version of Gaim, it's already been
     replaced with my Tray Icon plugin.                 (closes: #180640)
  * Add a note in the description, and a longer one in README.Debian,
     explaining why gaim-gnome is gone. It's not coming back either.
     If I get any bugs about this I'm gonna be hella annoyed. Use the
     CVS debs from here:
      deb     http://people.debian.org/~robot101/gaim unstable cvs
      deb-src http://people.debian.org/~robot101/gaim unstable cvs
     And no, I will not upload them to sid. It's still buggy as hell.
  * Kill off gaim-common and gaim-gnome packages. Conflict and replace
     because all files belong to the gaim package now, and provide in
     the vain hope that apt/dpkg will choose gaim over old gaim-gnome
     packages and that I won't have to make a stub package.
  * Major crapectomy in debian/rules now that we're only building the
     one time. Thank god.
  * Add gaim.preinst to remove old /usr/share/doc/gaim symlink because
     dpkg wisely avoids transitions between symlinks and directories
     and vice versa.
  * Updated build-depends to exclude GNOME and libpanel-applet, include
     esd, have libaudio-dev instead of nas-dev, and no longer require
     perl 5.8 (sid is 5.6 on all arches now).
  * Update standard version to 3.6.8.

gaim (1:0.59.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. Various bug fixes including a remote crash bug
     with malicious AIM rendezvous packets.
  * Includes patch from CVS to fix Yahoo login problems - sends protocol
     version 0x0900 instead of 0x0600.
  * Yahoo i18n patch was included in this release.      (closes: #170542)
  * Fixed a small error causing the "Insert Smiley" button to crash when
     offline.                                           (closes: #175442)
  * Replaced invasive automatic config.{guess,sub} updating from
     debian/rules and replaced with much saner symlinking method.
  * Murdered pallet of gaim-menu.xpm (for the Debian menu entry) 
     according to the idotic menu policy, to shut lintian up.
  * This release is from the upstream 'gtk1-stable' branch. If you like
     Gtk2, or use GNOME 2 or KDE 3.1, please consider trying my Gaim CVS
     snapshot debs. The Gtk2 port is being worked on in CVS, and as a
     result this version is a little buggier and has some regressions,
     including no working IM image support and no protocol specific
     smileys, but it does have infinitely better i18n, looks a lot
     prettier, has support for session management (ie start at login in
     GNOME 2), and also features my Tray Icon plugin, which replaces the
     applet, and is visible in system-tray-applet in GNOME 2, or the
     normal Kicker system tray in KDE 3.1. Please mail me directly with
     any bugs you find in these, rather than filing them in the BTS. The
     apt lines are:

gaim (1:0.59.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

     is loaded. Sigh. Roll on 0.60 with Gtk2 goodness.  (closes: #152274)

gaim (1:0.59.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, sorry about the delay. Considering 0.59.3-1
     contained most of the fixes that went into 0.59.4, I didn't bother
     packaging it. The only changes to 0.59.5 are to fix a crash in the
     Yahoo plugin due to a slight change in the protocol.
  * Updated config.sub from 20020621 to 20020905 and config.guess from 
     20020529 to 20020903.

  * Applied fixes from upstream CVS:
     - remove Ctrl+K binding for colour
     - fix yahoo memleak
     - make the edit tab in the blist scrollable horizontally
     - apply patch from A Lee to do charset transitions character by

  * New upstream version.
  * Revert all patches here, everything's included.
  * Except for a blooper upstream which removes spaces from MSN and Yahoo
     screen names, and adds random NULs instead. Doh! Pulled fix from
     CVS.

 -- Robert McQueen <robot101@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Sep 2002 02:22:05 +0100

gaim (1:0.59.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update build-deps to libgnome-dev (>= 1.4.2-3) and
     libpanel-applet-dev (>= 1.4.1-2) to ensure imlib1/png2 is used.
  * Minor modification from Matt Wilson at RedHat to fix UTF8 font

gaim (1:0.59.1-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * The 'getting sick of this now' release. Third time lucky and all...
  * Ryan Murray (of gdk-pixbuf-dev fame) suggests dropping the new build
     dependencies and gently hacking the Makefile to substitute them out
     of linking the applet, because they're not actually necessary. This
     will also fix libpng2/3 compatibility issues that were making the
     applet fall back to the ugly xpm icon (until Christian Marillat
     stops being an idiot and links GNOME 1.4 against libpng2 again).
  * Thanks to Lukas Geyer (of JimButton fame) for pointing me at the
     right make features I needed to accomplish this without too much
     hacking.
  * Include a patch from Chris Blizzard (of RedHat fame) to fix an
     oversight in my fix for the browser security vunlerability. Access
     to unallocated memory in the non-manual browser handlers could have
     caused crashes in some situations. Cheers Chris. Sorry everyone.
  * Also edit the default manual browser command to not contain quotes
     any more. Debian should get a /usr/bin/sensible-browser or
     something.

gaim (1:0.59.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Well, that's the reason. gdk-imlib-dev dropped the dependencies for
     lib{jpeg,png,tiff,gif}-dev because apparently they're not necessary.
     libgnome-dev probably needs to add these.
  * Added build-deps on libpng3-dev and libtiff3g-dev, so that Gaim can
     finally build on the buildds without me NMUing libgnome-dev in a fit
     of anger.
  * Set urgency back to high to hammer the point home. If this doesn't
     build I'm going to be mighty annoyed.
  * Changed gaim-gnome depend to gnome-panel (<< 1.5). It doesn't work
     with GNOME 2. I'm writing a docklet for that.

  * New upstream version from the gtk1-stable branch. Merges my browser.c

  * Upstream merged patch for fixed i18n with libiconv.

  * Added libjpeg-dev build-dep. GNOME 1.4 is messed up in a half-baked
     libpng2 -> 3 transition, and this dep must've fallen out somewhere
     else along with someone's brain. Should let the security fix build
     and propogate to sarge.

gaim (1:0.59-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Wrote patch to fix hideously insecure execution of unescaped
     arbitrary strings through the shell for the Manual browser URL click
     handler. Replaces any spaces in the URL with +, and runs the user's
     browser command directly without the shell. Users will soon learn
     not to quote the %s in their browser command.      (closes: #157909)
  * Added libungif4-dev to build-deps. Looks like someone's brain fell
     out. Ho hum.
  * Updated config.sub from 20020307 to 20020621, and config.guess from

gaim (1:0.58-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * The 'DOH!' release.
  * New upstream version, lots of nice stuff. See the changelog. =)
  * To avoid upsetting upgrades, gaim-common now replaces suitably old
     gaim-gnome packages because iconaway.so moved.     (closes: #144945)
  * Another attempt by upstream to fix those annoying 'Already there'
     MSN errors.                                        (closes: #145722)
  * Fixes GNOME applet transparency problems.           (closes: #145915)
  * In the previous version, the MSN plugin got secure logins to Hotmail
     that used MD5 auth cookies in a file which was opened in the
     browser, and would log you straight into your inbox. Ironically,
     this improved security used blatantly insecure tempfiles, which
     were also created with the 644 mode, leaving the way open for
     symlink attacks, and anyone on your system reading your mail. This
     is fixed in this release.                          (closes: #146750)
  * Not to mention the overflow in the Jabber plugin that got fixed.
  * Automatic update of config.sub from 20010907 to 20020307, and
     config.guess from 20010904 to 20020320.

     more.                                              (closes: #137058)
  * Updated README.Debian to take account of this.

 -- Robert McQueen <robot101@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Mar 2002 19:46:42 +0000

gaim (1:0.54-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. Goodies like IM Image sending for Oscar,
     protocol specific smileys, off-line message and improved
     typing notification support for Yahoo, DCC chat and mIRC formatting
     support for IRC, and lots of general bugfixes, especially
     pertaining to never being asked to accept/decline MSN buddies who
     add you when you're off-line.                      (closes: #138472)
  * Medium urgency upload because 0.53 was buggy but I had to let 0.53-2
     go in to testing because of the nul vulnerability.
  * The six (!) patches in 0.53-2 from CVS are all included in this
     version.
  * 'Oscar' protocol renamed to 'Oscar / ICQ' upstream. (closes: #137061)
  * Applied patch from me, already accepted upstream, with various
     cleanups to fix unusual sound behaviour:
      - attempting to play an internal sound with a command now
         generates an error instead of silently failing
      - attempting to play a file with the native method now warns
         before probably failing
      - the 'Test' button in the sound preferences now temporarily
         enables the sound under test, so it always tries to play it
      - using a command to play sounds is now a seperate option that
         must be explicitly enabled, avoiding problems with testing for
         other options happening before testing if a command had been
         specified                                      (closes: #137010)
  * Now building the non-GNOME version against ESD to make sound support
     more useful. Native sound support can only be expected to work for
     internal sounds.                                   (closes: #137013)
  * Remove the .h files from gaim-common. It turns out to be very hard
     indeed to make Gaim plugins build outside the Gaim source tree. I
     will probably make a gaim-plugins package with a few worthy plugins
     like the russian charset conversion, xosd signon/signoff
     notification, etc - I'm open to suggestions. Plugins must be
     runtime configurable (unlike irc-extras), actually useful (unlike
     the one to arbitrarily change your idle time), and build against
     the latest Gaim.
  * Include the licq2gaim.pl buddy list import script in the examples 
     dir in gaim-common.

     - closing a conversation window when a buddy is typing doesn't
       cause a crash       [debian/patches/close-typing-buddy-crash.diff]
     - server-side buddy lists are disabled for ICQ over Oscar to avoid
       mysterious bugs with authentication-required buddies not

gaim (1:0.51-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed description of gaim-gnome to make it obvious that it is a
     panel applet.
  * Made gaim-gnome depend on gnome-panel. It's unreasonable to request 
     that libpanel-applet0 does so, but gaim-gnome is useless without
     it.                                                (closes: #131233)

  * The 'Hi anyone on gaim's PTS' release.
  * New upstream version, mostly bug fixes.             (closes: #130737)
  * Upstream developer Eric Warmenhoven departs... thanks for all of
     your help and effort - you'll be greatly missed by all.
  * According to him, crashes were caused by a Gtk+ bug which has now
     been worked around.                                (closes: #115538)
  * He removed the help message a few weeks ago because I said it didn't
     wrap properly... not sure how helpful that was though.
                                                        (closes: #125310)
  * He also grappled with the GNOME panel to implement transparent
     backgrounds as best he could. The Gaim applet icon will have the
     same background image as the panel, but it will not line up with
     the panel's because the panel doesn't provide enough imformation to
     achieve that.                                      (closes: #128449)
  * Made gaim-common include a handful of .h files so that you can build
     plugins without the Gaim source - this opens the way for packaging
     plugins that don't come with Gaim. The reason is that I do not wish
     to include unofficial plugins in Gaim and accept responsibility for
     ensuring they work with the latest versions, or be forced to remove
     them from the package at a later date, sorry.      (closes: #129737)
  * I can no longer reproduce this bug with this new version, but I am
     also unable to determine if/when exactly it was fixed from the CVS
     logs. If you can still make it happen, please reopen it and I'll
     chase it up.                                       (closes: #117498)
  * Fixed a few minor errors in the manpage.   (closes: #130435, #130443)
  * Re-worked description to highlight mutli-protocol support.

  * Added a suitably scaled Debian menu icon for gaim.  (closes: #122302)
  * Re-ordered build to do the non-GNOME version first and install that
     'manually', so all the files from the GNOME applet get installed
     with the 'make install' target. This means gaim-gnome now contains
     the applet panel images.                           (closes: #122315)
  * Fixed re-declaration of time() in jabber/xtream.c.  (closes: #124390)

  * The 'grr... dpkg' release. Fixes possibly troublesome package
     relationship problems.
  * Made gaim-gnome conflict and replace old gaim packages.
  * Made gaim-common have a versioned depend on gaim or gaim-gnome,
     because a dpkg bug seemed to let you install an old gaim-common
     with a new gaim or gaim-gnome, even though they have a versioned
     depend on gaim-common.
  * Added patch from CVS to support GnomeICU buddy list importing.
  * Added option to use Galeon as the browser.

                                                        (closes: #101562)
  * Autorecon plugin now has an exponential backoff to allow users to
     correct non-transient errors.                      (closes: #102042)
  * Changed 'buddy' prompt to 'contact' to make the Add Buddy dialog
     less AIM-specific.                                 (closes: #105460)
  * Users can now edit their alias with the MSN plugin. (closes: #110966)
  * Added postinst scripts for gaim and gaim-gnome to rmdir their dirs
     from /usr/share/doc if they exist, and replace them with symlinks
     to gaim-common.                                    (closes: #111127)
  * Seeing as we have to build twice, try and build as little as
     possible the first time round (just the gaim_applet binary and its
     dependencies) to make it more efficient.
  * Updated config.{sub,guess} from latest autotools-dev.
